## BrailleBuddy Case

Dimensions: 250 x 105 x 80 mm

Braille Buddy's Box case was made from MDF wood boards (3mm and 5mm) using a Lasercutter.
All Elements were cut from 5mm thick boards, except the box lid. 
The lid consists of two layers, each 3mm thick. The bottom layer serves as a storage surface for the playing cards while the top layer contains the indentations that show where cards can be placed.

For a more pleasant touch experience, the wooden surface has been sanded, the corners rounded and the entire box lacquered.
