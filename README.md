## BrailleBuddy

BrailleBuddy is a tangible user interface supporting children with visual impairments in learning Braille. It was created using a human-centered inclusive design process with interviews, six design iterations with prototypes, and feedback from experts, students, and teachers. Alleviating the need for supervision, the device could be used during breaks in school or at home, providing additional opportunities to experience Braille and individual audio feedback to support the users learning.
